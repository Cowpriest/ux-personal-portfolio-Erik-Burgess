My name is Erik Burgess and I am a Computer Science major.  I have programmed (in C++) a student records program that would take in new students and some info about them and create a searchable database that was capable of saving to file and loading a database from a file.  I have also programmed (in Assembly) a four function calculator that did not use any add, subtract, multiply, nor divide commands as well as a snake game that was purely extra credit.

I have ambitions of programming learning algorithms for animated robots that include path finding and dicision making.

## UX Team Project

My team and I designed and tested a fuax website we built called Autoscrap.  The vision for this website is to allow users to both purchase and sell car parts with relative ease.  Our demographic is both buyers and sellers alike.  After a fair amount of user tests, we have found that most of our features work as intended while only a handful of features need to be improved or removed altogether.  This experience has taught me how much planning and work needs to go into the design and creation of a website that will be successful in its operation with its userbase.
